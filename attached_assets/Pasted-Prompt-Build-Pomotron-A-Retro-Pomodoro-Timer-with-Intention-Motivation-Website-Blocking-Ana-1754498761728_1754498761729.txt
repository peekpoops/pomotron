Prompt: Build "Pomotron" – A Retro Pomodoro Timer with Intention, Motivation, Website Blocking & Analytics
Create a fully functional web app named Pomotron, a whimsical and retro-inspired productivity tool based on the Pomodoro technique. The app should be designed for users who struggle with procrastination and want help staying focused through intention-setting, distraction-blocking, and gentle motivation. It should integrate evidence-based productivity design while maintaining a fun 1980s aesthetic inspired by Stranger Things' Starcourt Mall — without any horror elements.

⏱️ Core Timer Flow
When the Start Session button is clicked:

Prompt the user to enter:

“What are you working on today?”

“Why is this important to you?”

Save both inputs to session history with timestamp.

Include a Pomodoro timer with:

Default: 25 min focus, 5 min break, 15 min long break.

Custom durations (see Settings).

Auto-start toggle for next session.

Soft start option (5-second countdown).

Number of cycles before long break (customizable).

Add a gentle nudge (notification or toast) if the user is idle for more than 5 minutes during a focus session (configurable).

add an "End Session" option to give users more control over their Pomodoro sessions. This will allow them to manually end a session before the timer completes.

Play unique retro sound effects:

When clicking Start

When clicking Reset

🔒 Website Blocking (Functional)
Allow users to add/remove websites to a blocklist.

When a blocked website is accessed during a focus session, it should redirect to 127.0.0.1.

Automatically unblock during breaks.

Re-block when a new session starts.

Optional: add "override with friction" confirmation when trying to bypass block.

📊 Analytics Dashboard
Replace all dummy data with real data from active sessions. Include:

Total Focus Sessions Completed

Focus Success Rate (e.g., completed / started)

Total Focus Time

Current Streak (consecutive days with ≥1 completed cycle)

Data auto-refreshes weekly.

“Recent Intentions” View:

Display the latest 7–10 session logs with:

📌 What task was worked on

💭 Why it mattered

🕒 Timestamp

Optional: scroll or paginate to view full history.

Option to export data or clear all.

🗑️ Remove:
The Motivation tab (redundant).

Any quotes that directly reference ADHD (to reduce stigma).

💬 Motivational Quotes (Compact UI)
Display rotating quotes on the Timer screen from:

Philosophers (e.g., Marcus Aurelius)

Productivity experts (e.g., Cal Newport, Mark manson)

Behavioral psychology

Keep layout minimal: small quote card or top banner.

⚙️ Settings Button → Admin Page
Settings should open a full Admin Page with:

Timer Configuration:
Custom focus/break/long break durations

Number of cycles before long break

Auto-start toggle

Soft start toggle (5-second countdown)

Idle-time nudge timeout (custom)

Visual Themes:
Starcourt Retro (default)

🧪 Technical Guidelines (Optional if using dev tools)
Use localStorage to persist data and preferences.

Build as a PWA for cross-platform support.

Ensure accessibility (for cognitive and visual load).

Add keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Spacebar = Start/Pause).
